# ARTS2K19

It gives me an immense pleasure to introduce you all to a fairly new innovation we tried to integrate with our college magazine - Prof Ram Meghe College of Engineering and Management's (PRMCEAM) TechnoStream 2K19, which is known as Augmented Reality (AR).If you are attached to technology, you have probably heard of AR. AR is a bridge between software and human, it allows us to interact with the virtual digital world embedded in the real world through digital devices.

Here in the photo gallery, you will see several photos with the AR logo:

The photos with this logo are scannable by our app which I will let you know shortly how to install and execute. You will see the different events of Engg...Joy 2019 (PRMCEAM's Cultural Fest) in a new way, this is not just a photo gallery, this is a video gallery!

Steps to explore AR in TechnoStream:

1. Download the Android app, ARTS, short for Augmented Reality TechnoStream, from the following link:

(bit.ly/ARTS19)

(Please keep at least 400 MB of free space in your mobile phone to download and install the app and trust me, it is worth the size!)

2. After downloading and installing ARTS, run the app, wait for a few seconds to let the app
load the required resources. 

3. After the camera is up and working, point it on the following image and you will see the results directly!
